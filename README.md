## About Commandersalt.com

"*Celebrating the saltiest MtG decks on the planet!*" ðŸ§‚

Commandersalt.com is a totally legitimate, definitely-not-a-meme deck analysis tool for Magic: The Gathering's Commander/EDH format. We'll tell you exactly why your deck is either a tryhard cEDH monstrosity ruining casual tables, or why it's actually just a 7 (spoiler: it's always a 7). Or a bracket 3. Or whatever.

### Key Features:
- **Salt Score Analysis**: Find out just how emotionally damaging your deck is to your playgroup
- **Power Level Analysis**: Get feedback that you probably won't like about how performant your deck is
- **Bracket Detection**: Analysis of what bracket your deck falls into in terms of Wizards of the Coast guidelines, as well as realistic bracket level (you probably also won't like this)
- **Combo Detection**: We'll let you know if you're *that person* who makes everyone watch you play solitaire


### How It Works:
1. Visit [commandersalt.com](https://commandersalt.com)
2. Paste your deck link
3. Get roasted by our obviously untested and highly disingenuous algorithm
4. Argue about the results on Discord and Reddit (it's tradition)
